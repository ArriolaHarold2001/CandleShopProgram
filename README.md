# Candle Shop

This was one of my final Assignments in an introduction to JAVA class. I enjoyed making this so much that I added some easter eggs in the code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository using HTTPS link
2. Open project in your preffered IDE
3. Run the Java project
   1. Running the Project looks different depending on your IDE but most I have seen have Run/Debug buttons that will automatically find the main function and run the program.

## Output

Once you run the program you get prompts asking how many candles of different kinds you would like to purchase. After answering the prompts you get a receipt:

```JAVA
Receipt

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Luscious Lavender
Amount: 3
Burn Time: 5 hours
Dollar per Burn Time: 1.50
Price: $7.50
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Fragrant Floral's
Amount: 5
Burn Time: 7 hours
Dollar per Burn Time: 2.68
Price: $18.75
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Spicy N' Dicey
Amount: 2
Burn Time: 12 hours
Dollar per Burn Time: 1.00
Price: $11.98
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Total Burn Time: 74
Total Dollar per Burn Time: 5.18
Total Price: 38.23
```

Each Candle will have its individual values and then you will get a total amount from all the candles purchased

- Amount = amount of candle(s)
- Burn Time = Estimate of time candles will burn for
- Dollar per Burn Time = The total price / Burn Time
- Price = Price of candle(s)
